Concept of Caring

- The LPN faculty believes that nursing is a practice discipline with caring as its core concept
- Practical nurses are integral and valued members of the family of nursing
- Practical nurses care for clients cognizant of their unique biological, psychosocial, spiritual and environmental uniqueness and complexity (EVERYBODY IS DIFFERENT :) )
- Care for clients at all stages of the health and developmental continua
- Care for clients by promoting, maintaining and restoring health, preventing illness and/or injury, and providing palliation
- Practical nurses care for clients within the scope of practice directed by a governing body and local employer
