There are six levels of organization within the human body:

- Chemical level
  
 Chemical refers to atoms combining to make molecules combine to form organelles which are the basis of cells. Basic living unit of all organisms.
 
- Cellular level
  
Estimates say there are 100 trillion dynamic, living cells in the human body! These cells are various sizes, shapes and structures and provide a number of different functions.
  
- Tissue level
  
  Composed of similar cells with a common function. Ie: epithelial, muscle, connective, nervous.
  
- Organ level
  
  Two or more tissues that combine to make a complex structure and work together to perform a specific function are systems. Ex: skin, heart, stomach.
  
- System
  
Several organs that work together to accomplish a function. Ex: digestive system, CV system, etc.  
  
- Organism level

The most complex level. Made up of several systems that work together to maintain life.
