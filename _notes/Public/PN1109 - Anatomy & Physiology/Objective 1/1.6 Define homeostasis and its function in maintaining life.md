**[[Homeostasis]]** refers to a constant internal environment even though the outside world is continually changing.

Derived from the Greek homeo (meaning “the same”) and –stasis (meaning “staying”)

A lack of homeostasis leads to illness or disease.

All organ systems of body, under direction from the nervous and endocrine system, work together to maintain homeostasis.

#### Homeostatic Control

Any condition or stimulus that disrupts the homeostasis in the body is called a **[[Stressor]]**.

The factor or event being regulated is called the **[[Variable]]**

There are three (3) mechanisms:

**Receptor**

Monitors environment and responds to stimuli to send info to the control center (afferent pathway).

**Control Center**

Determines the set point (range) of the variable. Info then flows to the effector on an efferent  pathway.

**Effector** 

Provides the means for the controls response to the stimuli. The results of the response then feed back to influence the effect of the stimulus.
