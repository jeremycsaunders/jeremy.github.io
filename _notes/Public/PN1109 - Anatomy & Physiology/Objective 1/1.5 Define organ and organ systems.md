An **[[Organ]]** is a discrete structure composed of at least two
tissue types (four is more common) that performs a specific
function for the body.

The liver, the brain, and a blood vessel are very different from the stomach, but each is an organ. You can think of each organ of the body as a specialized functional center responsible for a necessary activity that no other organ can perform.

Organs that work together to accomplish a common purpose
make up an **[[Organ System]]**. 

For example, the heart and blood vessels of the cardiovascular system circulate blood continuously
to carry oxygen and nutrients to all body cells. Besides the cardiovascular system, the other organ systems of the body are the integumentary, skeletal, muscular, nervous, endocrine, lymphatic, respiratory, digestive, urinary, and reproductive systems.
