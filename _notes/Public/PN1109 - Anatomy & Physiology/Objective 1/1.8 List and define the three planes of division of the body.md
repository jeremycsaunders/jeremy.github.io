### Sagittal Plane

Lengthwise cuts the body into two halves - left & right.
It is sometimes called the longitudinal section.

If the cut passes through the midline of the body, it is called a midsagittal plane.

### Frontal

Divides the body into anterior and posterior (front to back).
This is also referred to as the *Coronal Plane*

### Transverse

A horizontal plane or crosswise plane.
It is perpendicular to the saggital plane.
Divides the body into upper and lower portions.
